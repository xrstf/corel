Welcome to the Otto interpreter :)
----------------------------------

You can enter one of

 * a path expression, like `.foo` or `.foo[0].bar`
   to access the global document.
 * an expression like (+ .foo 42) to compute data by
   functions; see https://github.com/xrstf/otti for a
   list of all available functions and expressions.
 * a scalar JSON value, like `3` or `[1 2 3]`, which
   will simply return that exact value with no further
   side effects. Not super useful usually.

Additionally, the following commands can be used:

help – Show this help text.
exit – Exit Otti immediately.
